1. First run the crawler.py, it will create 2 csv files 'journal_ranking.csv' and 'conference_ranking.csv' with conference keys, names, and rankings.
2. To successfully load the data into PostgreSQL, make sure to change the [absolute paths] in 'integration.sql' to the paths of the two csv's above. Then run 'integration.sql'.
3. The distribution table for question 3 is distribution3, for question 4 is distribution4.
